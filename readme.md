# UoS Artemis<sup>3</sup> - 1 Thermal Analysis Tool
Python-based tool using numerical ODE solving, basic matrix operations and pre-designed physical formulae to model the thermal operations of the Artemis<sup>3</sup> - 1 CubeSat probe.
## Currently Still in Development
However most of the logical/mathematical concepts are here <br>
Heavily borrowed from the documentation for the SatTherm, TSS and University of Georgia CubeSat mission Thermal Analysis:
